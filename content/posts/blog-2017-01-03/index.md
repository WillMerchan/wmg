##2016 Mission
I went into 2016 with the goal of leveling up my development skills and filling in some of the gaps I was missing when building front ends. Before this I had spent most of my development time reverse-engineering existing code and tweaking parts to achieve a desired outcome. I didn't have a solid understanding of the languages and what was happening as a whole. I started this process at the end of 2015 by taking part in [makerscabin.com](https://makerscabin.com/). It definitely provided a great explanation of core PHP principles, working with templates and building databases. 

At this point I knew some more specific areas I wanted to learn about, including Laravel, React, Flexbox, and a better handle on SASS. I took [reactforbeginners.com](https://reactforbeginners.com/) which was an incredible dive into React and allowed me to use it on my own site, with much less confusion than I would have had otherwise. At the same time I was still working on my front end toolset including learning Flexbox via [flexbox.io](http://flexbox.io/) and [flexboxfroggy.com](http://flexboxfroggy.com/). I was working on the front end a lot and decided to dedicate some time to improving my design process as well, by improving my Sketch workflow with the help of [leveluptutorials.com](https://leveluptutorials.com/tutorials).

##Midway Point
About halfway through the year, I had been continuously learning one topic or another, and definitely noticed an increased ability in what I could build and how much I could understand the conversations I would see happening online. I went to Laracon 16' and it was there I realized how much more I needed to understand of Laravel and VueJs. I had been rebuilding my site, using a static site builder based on Laravel called [statamic.com](https://statamic.com/) and was able to start introducing some of the new things I had learned, but really wanted to push it even further. I took a few classes from [laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com/) on PHP principles, JavaScript fundamentals, building projects with Laravel, and using Vue 2.0. In November of 2016 I was able to launch the latest version of my site using VueJs for the front page toggle, a more advanced and BEM styled CSS structure, and a better understanding of what was happening from the server management to the animation debugging of the JS. 

I was feeling pretty good at this point about what I had accomplished, and knew there was still many gaps I needed to fill in for my knowledge of Vue and Laravel, more having to do with the PHP and Javascript underlying foundations. But I had a good grasp on the frameworks, at least enough to know why they were a benefit.

##Looking towards 2017
While I was continuing on my learning path I wanted to expand my network, open opportunities and go into 2017 with many things on the Horizon. In December, I went to 3 Meetups and learned from some great designers and entrepreneurs on design systems, early stage products and more about the startup scene in my area. I also took part in [https://www.outofofficehours.com/](https://www.outofofficehours.com/) started by [@dustin](https://twitter.com/dustin). Over the course of 2 weeks I met with [@thinmatt](https://twitter.com/thinmatt), [@renn](https://twitter.com/renn), [@cfaydi](https://twitter.com/cfaydi), and [@Brilliancrank](https://twitter.com/Brilliantcrank). What I learned from these individuals was invaluable. Probably worthy of a blog post on its own. But it provided great introspection into my career and what value I could offer, as well as what were some opportunities to further my growth in the coming year.

In the last 2 weeks of 2016 I started planning for hosting an event in spring of 2017, getting halfway through a client branding and site project, starting a conversation about building a template library for a potential client, and in the midway point of launching a side project of my own. I plan on keeping this pace up, and I can't wait to see what doors open in 2017 as a result of 2016's grind!
