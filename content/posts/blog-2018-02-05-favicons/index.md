Whichever way you pronounce favicon, it's probably one of those items on your site checklist which you remember to get to right before you launch your site, or maybe even a little after you launch it. Although a simple concept, there's a lot more to favicons these days than a simple .ico file. 

##A Little Background


## What You Want To Cover

## How To Get It Done
It would be extremely tedious to create all these image assets one by one everytime you need to generate favicons, luckily there's a really convenient site which guides you through the process. I always use [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) when I need to make a set of favicons. To get started it's best to use a high res (at least 260 x 260) PNG file or an SVG file as your upload source. You'll get better results if you use a source file which has no background on it. Take a look below, if I use the image on the left it'll cause certain single tone variations of the favicon to look like a filled in circle.

##Filtering Out The Noise
It's easy to get overwhelmed when trying to solve the issue by assuming software will be the answer. While the right tools certainly helps, it's the process which makes it all work. I went through and tested all the prototyping software I could find as well as toyed with the idea of delivering front end code, but ultimately landed on a combo of using Sketch and [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) (with the [Craft plugin](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft)) to help describe what we wanted in production version of our designs. As designers we sometimes assume developers will infer micro states of design elements the same way we do. This is the purpose of design documentation, and something which I haven't seen worked into many design tools effectively. Invision allows us to specify the sizes and formats of our designs in a non-intrusive and intuitive manner.
